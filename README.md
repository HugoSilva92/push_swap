# Grade 100/125

This was the introduction for algorithms.

The bonus is there, the only problem was that I didn't treated the empty command.

Somewhere in the future I'm going to deliver it for the 125, right now I'm lacking the time and points.

It was a difficult project, invested lot more time that I've gained with it.

At least it gave me knowledge.

Subject of the project included on repository.
